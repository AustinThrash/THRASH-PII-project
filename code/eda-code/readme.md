# EDA Code

This folder contains code to do a simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the processed/cleaned data. The code produces a few tables and figures, which are saved in the appropriate `results` sub-folder.

This code creates the following figures:

-   Variable distributions

-   Variable importance

-   Correlation Matrix

The figures can be located in '../results/figures' of this repository.
